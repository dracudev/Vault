For React projects, the following naming conventions are generally recommended:

1. **PascalCase**: For React components and class names.
    - Example: `MyComponent`, `UserProfile`.
2. **camelCase**: For variables, functions, and object properties.
    - Example: `myVariable`, `handleClick`.
3. **kebab-case**: For file and folder names.
    - Example: `my-component.js`, `user-profile`.

```sh
src

+-- app               # application layer containing:
|   |                 # this folder might differ based on the meta framework used
|   +-- routes        # application routes / can also be pages
|   +-- app.tsx       # main application component
|   +-- provider.tsx  # application provider that wraps the entire application with different global providers - this might also differ based on meta framework used
|   +-- router.tsx    # application router configuration
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
