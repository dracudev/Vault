Format specifiers are placeholders within the format string of `printf` that determine how subsequent arguments are formatted and displayed. They begin with a `%` character and are followed by specific characters that dictate the type and formatting of the output.

### Common Format Specifiers

Here are some common format specifiers and their meanings:

- `%d` or `%i`: Signed decimal integer.
- `%u`: Unsigned decimal integer.
- `%f`: Floating-point number (decimal notation).
- `%e` or `%E`: Floating-point number (scientific notation).
- `%c`: Single character.
- `%s`: String.
- `%x` or `%X`: Unsigned hexadecimal integer.
- `%o`: Unsigned octal integer.
- `%%`: A literal `%` character.

### Components of a Format Specifier

A format specifier can have several components, including:

1. **Flags**: Optional characters that modify the output format. Common flags include:
   - `-`: Left-justify the output within the given field width.
   - `+`: Always show the sign of a number.
   - `0`: Pad the field with zeros instead of spaces.
   - `#`: Use an alternate form (e.g., `0x` prefix for hexadecimals).

2. **Width**: An optional number specifying the minimum field width. If the converted value is shorter, it is padded with spaces (or zeros if the `0` flag is used).

3. **Precision**: An optional number following a `.` that specifies the number of digits to appear after the decimal point for floating-point numbers or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string.

4. **Length Modifier**: Optional characters that modify the length of the data type. For example:
   - `h`: Short (e.g., `short int`).
   - `l`: Long (e.g., `long int`).
   - `ll`: Long long (e.g., `long long int`).

5. **Conversion Specifier**: The character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied (e.g., `d`, `f`, `s`, etc.).

### Example

For example, in the format specifier `%10.2f`:
- `%` indicates the start of the format specifier.
- `10` is the width, meaning the total field should be 10 characters wide.
- `.2` is the precision, indicating 2 digits should appear after the decimal point.
- `f` is the conversion specifier, indicating a floating-point number.
