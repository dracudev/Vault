# Iterative Functions in C

Iterative functions in C are functions that use loops (such as `for`, `while`, or `do-while`) to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specified condition is met. These functions are essential for tasks that require repeated execution or iteration over a sequence of operations.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void countdown(int n) {
    while (n > 0) {
        printf("%d ", n);
        n--;
    }
    printf("Liftoff!\n");
}

int main() {
    countdown(5); // Output: 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff!
    return 0;
}
```
