To remove a specific item from the list, either by its index from the beginning of the list or by its value, we will need to go over all the items, continuously looking ahead to find out if we've reached the node before the item we wish to remove. This is because we need to change the location to where the previous node points to as well.

Here is the algorithm:

1. Iterate to the node before the node we wish to delete
2. Save the node we wish to delete in a temporary pointer
3. Set the previous node's next pointer to point to the node after the node we wish to delete
4. Delete the node using the temporary pointer

There are a few edge cases we need to take care of, so make sure you understand the code.

```c
int remove_by_index(node_t ** head, int n) {
    int i = 0;
    int retval = -1;
    node_t * current = *head;
    node_t * temp_node = NULL;

    if (n == 0) {
        return pop(head);
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        if (current->next == NULL) {
            return -1;
        }
        current = current->next;
    }

    if (current->next == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }

    temp_node = current->next;
    retval = temp_node->val;
    current->next = temp_node->next;
    free(temp_node);

    return retval;

}
```
