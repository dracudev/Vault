Removing the last item from a list is very similar to adding it to the end of the list, but with one big exception - since we have to change one item before the last item, we actually have to look two items ahead and see if the next item is the last one in the list:

```c
int remove_last(node_t * head) {
    int retval = 0;
    /* if there is only one item in the list, remove it */
    if (head->next == NULL) {
        retval = head->val;
        free(head);
        return retval;
    }

    /* get to the second to last node in the list */
    node_t * current = head;
    while (current->next->next != NULL) {
        current = current->next;
    }

    /* now current points to the second to last item of the list, so let's remove current->next */
    retval = current->next->val;
    free(current->next);
    current->next = NULL;
    return retval;

}
```
