The `printf` function in C and other programming languages is used primarily to format and output data to the standard output stream (usually the console). It accepts a format string followed by a variable number of arguments. The format string contains conversion specifiers that control how the subsequent arguments are formatted and displayed.

1. **Format String**: 
   - This is a string literal that can contain ordinary characters (which are copied directly to the output) and format specifiers (which are replaced by the formatted representation of corresponding arguments).

2. **Conversion Specifiers**: 
   - Begin with a `%` character followed by specific characters that determine the type and formatting of each argument. For example, `%d` for integers, `%f` for floating-point numbers, `%s` for strings, etc.

3. **Variable Number of Arguments**: 
   - `printf` can accept multiple arguments after the format string. The number and types of these arguments depend on the format specifiers in the format string.

4. **Output to Standard Output**: 
   - Once formatted, the resulting string is typically displayed on the standard output (console). It can also be redirected to files or other output streams using file redirection or similar mechanisms.

### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    float pi = 3.14159;
    char name[] = "John Doe";

    // Example usage of printf
    printf("Integer: %d, Float: %f, String: %s\n", num, pi, name);

    return 0;
}
