Memory overlap occurs when two or more dynamically allocated memory blocks share overlapping memory addresses. This can happen unintentionally, leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
```c
int *ptr1 = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
int *ptr2 = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));

// Assume a programming mistake where ptr1 and ptr2 overlap
```
### Handling Integer Overflow
Handling memory overlap in C involves ensuring that dynamically allocated memory blocks do not share overlapping memory addresses, which can lead to unintended consequences such as data corruption or undefined behavior. Here are several strategies and considerations for managing memory overlap effectively:

### 1. Avoid Overlapping Memory Blocks

The most straightforward approach is to avoid creating overlapping memory blocks in the first place. When dynamically allocating memory, ensure that each allocation is distinct and does not overlap with existing allocations.
### 2. Use `calloc` for Zero-Initialized Memory

When allocating memory using `calloc`, the memory is zero-initialized, which can help in detecting accidental overlaps or out-of-bound accesses more easily during debugging.
### 3. Use `realloc` Carefully

When resizing dynamically allocated memory using `realloc`, be cautious to ensure that the resulting memory block does not overlap with existing data.
